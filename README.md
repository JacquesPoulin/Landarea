# "LANDAREA" (react app)

### > Hackathon React App (think for mobile devices) 

This is our first 24h Hackathon project, done during our Full-stack Bootcamp at the Wild Code School.
The challenge was to create a functional mobile app in 24h.

With this app everyone can give or grab some plants,
instead of waste / trash them, and give them a second life.

With our team Antso, Damien, Jacques, Johnny et RÃ©mi,
we are glad to share this challenge with all of you !
